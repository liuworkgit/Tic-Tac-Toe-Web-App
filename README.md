# Tick-Tac-Toe Web Game
This project is a tick-tac-toe web game that can be played in the browser. This was made according to the specifications of [The Odin Project's tick-tac-toe project.](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe)

# User Stories
Anyone using this app should be able to do the following:
- The user should be able to start a new game.
- The user should be able to mark one of the boxes of the tick-tac-toe grid, and only one at a time, before the game switches to the other player's turn.
- The user should be able to see which boxes on the grid they've marked.
- The user should be able to see whose turn it is.
- In the case of a win or tie, the user should be able to restart the game and clear the grid.

# Future Goals
After completing this project, I would like to add the following:
- Allow the players to put in their names before the game starts.
- Add a pop-up that announces which player won/if there was a tie when the game finishes.
- A tracker which counts the number of wins/ties.
